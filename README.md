# SmartEducation

Smart Education is a learning management software (LMS) platform used by educational institutions, businesses, and organizations to create, manage, and deliver online courses and training programs. The project aims to develop an LMS that can cater to the needs of various educational and training programs.

The learning management software will have the following features:

User Authentication and Access Control: The LMS will allow users to create accounts and manage access to different courses and content based on their user roles.

Course Management: Course creators will be able to create and upload course materials such as text, images, videos, and quizzes. They will also be able to manage student enrollments, track student progress, and award certificates of completion.

Communication and Collaboration: The LMS will have features for communication and collaboration, such as discussion forums, chat, and messaging.

Analytics and Reporting: The LMS will track and analyze student progress, such as time spent on each lesson, quiz scores, and overall progress. It will generate reports that can be used by course creators and administrators to monitor the effectiveness of the courses.

The learning management software will be built using a web framework such as Django , Django provides a powerful Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework where pythoncode isused instead of SQL tointeract with databases tables . It will also require front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The project will involve designing and implementing the database schema, creating user authentication and access control, developing course management features, implementing communication and collaboration tools, and generating analytics and reports.
